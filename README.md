=======

A bare-bones HTML5 base theme for starting a custom Drupal 7 project.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This theme is useful for those who like to code their own custom theme, rather than use a base like Omega or Zen. It only provides little more than boilerplate.

Some features...

* Grid-based layout using lightweight Semantic.gs mix-ins
* Easy to set-up for both fixed-width and adaptive designs
* Makes use of HTML5 and SCSS
